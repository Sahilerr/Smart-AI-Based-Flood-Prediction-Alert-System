Title: Smart AI-Based Flood Prediction & Alert System for Maharashtra

Flooding is a recurring issue in Maharashtra, especially in cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik, due to rapid urbanization, poor drainage, and extreme weather events. Existing flood warning systems often rely on static models and historical data, making them less effective for real-time disaster preparedness.

This project proposes a Smart AI-powered flood prediction and alert system that integrates:

Real-time weather data (via APIs such as OpenWeatherMap and IMD)

River water levels and satellite imagery (from ISRO/NASA)

Machine learning & deep learning models (LSTMs, Random Forest, CNNs)

IoT-based sensors for on-ground monitoring

The system will:

Predict floods dynamically with higher accuracy.

Provide early alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, and mobile applications.

Display an interactive flood risk map for citizens and authorities.

Assist disaster management teams with decision support, resource allocation, and evacuation planning.

By combining AI, real-time data, and predictive analytics, the system aims to minimize property damage, improve preparedness, and save lives in flood-prone regions(Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, and Kolhapur) of Maharashtra.
